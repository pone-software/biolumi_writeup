This document summarizes the study on the expected local coincidence (LC) trigger rate in the 16PMT POM due to bioluminescense (BL).

# Assumptions
BL emission from an individual organism is assumed to be pointlike, isotropic and monochromatic (420nm). The emission positions are distributed according to the [Fourth-Day](https://github.com/MeighenBergerS/fourth_day) model, which assumes that BL is caused mainly by turbulence-induced shear forces. The positions available for sampling are shown in fig. @fig-fd-empos .
As BL emission is biological, we assume that the time emission profile is uniform on the time scales considered for this study.

#| echo: false
#| label: fig-fd-empos
#| fig-cap: "Fourth Day Emission Positions"
#| column: margin
bio_pos_df = Vector{Float64}.(JSON.parsefile(joinpath(pkg_dir, "../assets/relative_emission_positions.json")))

scatter(
    reduce(hcat, [pos[1:2] for pos in bio_pos_df]),
    axis=(; xlabel="x (m)", ylabel="y (m)"))

```

# Photon Propagation Setup
Source positions are drawn from the Fourth-Day positional distribution. At each position, a monochromatic, isotropic emitter is placed. A fixed number of photons is emitted uniformely over a time range of $10^7$ns.
A P-OM receiver is placed at $(0, 0, 0)$. 
For each simulation run, a fixed number $N$ of emitters is drawn, each emitting $10^9/N$ photons.
Photons are propagated with the [PhotonPropagation.jl](https://github.com/PLEnuM-group/PhotonPropagation.jl) package, using the standard optical properties for Cascadia Basin.

After propagation, photons are attributed to the indivdual PMTs and are resampled according to their total weight (includes absorption in water and quantum efficiency). 

In order to calculated the expected PMT rate in STRAW for each emitter configuration, an additional simulation is run, where the receiver is replaced by a single, upwards-facing PMT.

Angular acceptance is currently *not* taken into account (ie FOV is $180^\circ$).

# Trigger Logic
A local-coindince trigger algorithm is run on all hits from each simulation run.
The algorithm is implemented as follows:

```julia
"""
    lc_trigger(sorted_hits::AbstractDataFrame, time_window)

Calculate local-coincidence triggers for `sorted_hits` in `time_window`.

The algorithm loops through all hits ``h_i``. When the next hit ``h_j`` is closer than the
time window ``\\delta`` a new trigger is started. The trigger will accumulate all hits
``h_j`` that are within ``h_i + \\delta``. Finally, a trigger is emitted when it includes
hits on at least two different PMTs.

Returns a Vector of hit-time vectors.
"""
function lc_trigger(sorted_hits::AbstractDataFrame, time_window)

    triggers = []
    i = 1
    while i < nrow(sorted_hits)

        lc_flag = false

        j = i + 1
        while j <= nrow(sorted_hits)
            if (sorted_hits[j, :time] - sorted_hits[i, :time]) <= time_window
                lc_flag = true
            else
                break
            end
            j += 1
        end

        if !lc_flag
            i = j
            continue
        end

        if length(unique(sorted_hits[i:(j-1), :pmt_id])) >= 2
            push!(triggers, sorted_hits[i:(j-1), :])
        end

        i = j
    end
    return triggers
end
```
The LC trigger is run for different time-windows: 10ns, 15ns, 20ns and 30ns.

# Simulation Runs
Simulation runs are performed for different numbers of BL emitters. For each run, a new set of BL emission positions is drawn.
LC triggers are calculated per run. The result is grouped by the coincidence level (ie. the number of unique PMTs with at least one hit).
The LC trigger rate is the calculated as:
$$
R_k = N_k \cdot \frac{n_{\text{sim}} \cdot 10^7 }{10^9} ,
$$
where $N_k$ is the number of triggers at LC level $k$, $n_{\text{sim}}$ is the number of simulation runs for a given BL emitter number, and $10^7$ is the emission time window.
